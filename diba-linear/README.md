# Dataset `diba-linear`

Data from one session (animal gor01, June 7, 16:40:19) on a linear track from [Diba, K., & Buzs√°ki, G. (2007). Forward and reverse hippocampal place-cell sequences during ripples. Nature neuroscience, 10(10), 1241.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1961).

In particular, we include sorted spike times, ripple epochs, PBE epochs, PBEs (as binned spike trains), and position. LFP (EEG) is not included.

The spike trains are ordered by the peak firing locations on the track, so that replay events can easily be seen by visual inspection.

Example epoch at [t1, t2) = [1540, 1560).
