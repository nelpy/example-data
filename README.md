# Example-data
Collection of small (lightweight) datasets used in nelpy's examples and tutorials.

## Datasets include:
  * [**linear-track**](../master/linear-track)—15 minute run on a linear track, followed by 15 minutes of rest; position and spike data.
  * [**w-maze**](../master/w-maze)—run-rest-run-rest on a W-maze, each lasting approximately 15; position and spike data.
  * [**ripple-lfp**](../master/ripple-lfp)—local field potential (LFP) and position data for a short approx 10 minute recording in CA1.
  * [**spike-sorting**](../master/spike-sorting)—waveforms and spiketimes from a single tetrode.
  * [**running-wheel**](../master/running-wheel)—position, lick times, and other behavioral data for a mouse on a running wheel (treadmill).
  * [**diba-linear**](../master/diba-linear)—linear track with several replay examples; position, ripples, PBEs, and spike time data.
